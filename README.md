# Tic Tac Toe Java App

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Java App! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java, designed to run on Android Studio. 

## About the App

This app allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one of the players manages to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all the cells on the grid are filled.

## How to Use the App

3. **Build and Run the App**: Build and run the app on an Android emulator or a physical Android device.

4. **Gameplay Instructions**:
   
   - The app uses a basic command line interface within the Android app. 
   - When it's your turn, you will be prompted to input your move as coordinates (row and column numbers). 
   - To make a move, simply type the row and column numbers separated by a space and press the Enter key. For example, "1 2" would place your symbol in the first row, second column.
   - The app will update the grid and display it after each move.
   - The game continues until one player wins or there's a draw.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   
   - To win, a player must get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - The app will announce the winner or declare a draw when the game ends.
