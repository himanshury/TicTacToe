Tic Tac Toe Java App
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. The app allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one of the players manages to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all the cells on the grid are filled.
The app uses a basic command line interface, where the players are prompted to input their moves as coordinates (row and column numbers). The app then updates the grid and displays it after each move.
